COHERENCE: Adequate

GAPS: The quote tweet post does not directly align with the specific axes and browse context provided. While it touches on a broader theme of regime change, it lacks direct connection to the Philippine "War on Drugs" accountability, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, or historical narratives.

FRAMING: The one-liner is accurate but somewhat broad. It could be more specific to the contexts presented (e.g., addressing the risks and costs associated with U.S.-Iran conflicts or the Philippines' human rights concerns).

WATCH: Consider how the immediate celebration of regime change in Iran or the Philippines might impact long-term societal stability and accountability, especially given the current geopolitical tensions and calls for due process.
