COHERENCE: Adequate

GAPS: The commentary touches on multiple axes but doesn't clearly link them. The transition from judicial integrity to public discourse manipulation is a bit abrupt.

FRAMING: The one-liner accurately captures a key tension but oversimplifies the complex interplay of factors involved in the issues at hand.

WATCH: Consider how the use of "discourse" and "empathy erodes" relates specifically to the axes of judicial integrity, national sovereignty, and information authenticity.
