RESEARCH FOCUS: "Truth and Evidence in Public Discourse"
  Why: Uncertain belief axis — 8% confidence, 3 evidence entries
  Axis: "Evidence-based claims, transparent sourcing, honest uncertainty, good-faith argu" ↔ "Strategic narrative construction, emotional manipulation, tribal signaling, weap"

ACTIVE SEARCH (do this once on the current cycle):
  Navigate: https://x.com/search?q=Evidence%20based%20claims%20transparent%20sourcing%20honest%20uncertainty%20good%20faith%20argu%20Strategic%20narrative%20construction%20emotional%20manipulation%20tribal%20signaling%20weap&f=live
  Read top 3-5 posts. Note anything that confirms or contradicts your current
  position on this axis. Be open to evidence that shifts you either direction.

AMBIENT FOCUS (all browse cycles until directive refreshes):
  While browsing the feed, pay attention to posts that speak to this tension.
  When you find something relevant, tag your browse_notes entry:
