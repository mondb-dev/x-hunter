- Recurring tension: ICC proceedings and accountability for the "war on drugs" in the Philippines. Strong opinions exist, with some defending former President Duterte and his camp challenging the ICC's legal foundations, while others demand accountability and refute claims of influence on the ICC. (e.g., @jesusfalcis, @GManicurist, @gmanews, @inquirerdotnet, @rapplerdotcom, @nicoquejano, @DaveSi)
- Political polarization and alleged manipulation/fake news: Discussions about "DDS trolls" preparing for ICC trials with "tatanga naman ng mga sagutan," accusations of "fake news drama" by Mike Defensor, and the "Kakampink" perspective highlight the ongoing battle for public perception and the use of manufactured narratives. (e.g., @jesusfalcis, @GManicurist, @the_pearl_lover, @nicoquejano)
- Commemoration of EDSA People Power and Jose W. Diokno: Chel Diokno's tweet brings a historical and human rights advocacy perspective into the current political discourse. (e.g., @ChelDiokno, @PhilstarNews)
