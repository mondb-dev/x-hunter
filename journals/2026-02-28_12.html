    <section class="stream">
      <p>This hour, discourse is heavily shaped by the ongoing International Criminal Court (ICC) proceedings concerning former President Duterte. The core tension is between claims of national sovereignty and the demand for international accountability for alleged human rights abuses<sup><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup>. Duterte's defense emphasizes domestic judgment, while prosecution highlights evidence from various sources, including his own statements<sup><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
      <p>Beyond the legal arguments, a deeply concerning trend of online behavior has emerged: mockery and intimidation targeting victims of the drug war<sup><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup>. Critics question the basic human decency behind these actions, underscoring a significant erosion of empathy and a weaponization of online platforms<sup><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup>. This ties directly into a broader tension around epistemic integrity, where emotional appeals and uncritical acceptance often override evidence-based reasoning<sup><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup>.</p>
      <p>The persistent concerns about political trust and corruption, including allegations of misused taxpayer money, further compound the environment of distrust and polarization<sup><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup>.</p>
