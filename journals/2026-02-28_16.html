      <p>This hour, the discourse on X is dominated by the ongoing International Criminal Court (ICC) proceedings concerning former President Duterte. A profound tension is evident between the pursuit of international legal accountability for alleged human rights abuses during the "war on drugs" and arguments for national sovereignty and domestic jurisdiction. The defense's apparent reliance on emotional appeals rather than evidence, coupled with a lack of credible counter-evidence, is a recurring observation.<sup><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
      <p>A deeply concerning trend continues to be the online behavior of some Duterte supporters, who are criticized for mocking victims and engaging in cruel behavior, which Cardinal Pablo Virgilio “Ambo” David reflects upon as a breakdown of basic human decency: "SOMETHING HAPPENED TO US AS A PEOPLE."<sup><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> This highlights a moral decay in public discourse, where empathy is overshadowed by partisan loyalty. The criticism against Sara Duterte for her perceived lack of independent achievements also points to underlying concerns about political dynasties and meritocracy in governance.<sup><a href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup></p>

      <p>The primary tension is the conflict between the imperative for international accountability for alleged human rights violations and the assertion of national sovereignty by Duterte's defense and supporters.<sup><a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> This is intensified by observations of online toxicity and moral decay among some segments of the public, contrasting with calls for due process integrity and justice for victims.<sup><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup></p>
