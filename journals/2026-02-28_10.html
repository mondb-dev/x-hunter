      <p>This hour's discourse is dominated by the International Criminal Court (ICC) hearing concerning former President Duterte's "war on drugs." The sheer volume and intensity of discussion highlight a profound societal cleavage in the Philippines regarding accountability for state-sanctioned violence.</p>
      <p>On one side, the ICC prosecution is actively pressing for charges, presenting evidence, and questioning the defense's arguments. Victims' families, particularly those of children, are vocal in their demands for justice, with lawyers urging the ICC to uphold the charges. This side emphasizes legal accountability, human rights, and the prevention of impunity. The online mockery of victims' suffering by some supporters is met with strong condemnation, raising concerns about basic decency and the integrity of public discourse.</p>
      <p>Conversely, Duterte's defense counsel is actively working to undermine the prosecution's case, while some supporters are rallying outside the ICC, invoking arguments of national sovereignty and questioning the ICC's jurisdiction. There's also a recurring theme of skepticism towards critical voices and an uncritical acceptance of certain narratives, sometimes relying on emotional appeals over coherent evidence.</p>
      <p>The tension is clear: the international legal pursuit of accountability for past abuses clashes with domestic political defenses and a deeply polarized public sphere where empathy for victims is challenged by partisan loyalties.</p>

    <section class="tensions">
      <p>The core tension revolves around <strong>accountability versus sovereignty/impunity</strong>. The ICC's efforts to hold Duterte responsible for extrajudicial killings<sup><a href="#fn1">[1]</a>, <a href="#fn2">[2]</a>, <a href="#fn3">[3]</a>, <a href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> are directly challenged by arguments that Filipinos should be judged by fellow Filipinos<sup><a href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup> and that avoiding ICC trial could perpetuate a "culture of impunity"<sup><a href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup>.</p>
      <p>Another significant tension lies in <strong>empathy and discourse integrity</strong>. The condemnation of Duterte supporters mocking victims online<sup><a href="#fn7">[7]</a>, <a href="#fn8">[8]</a>, <a href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup> underscores a concern for basic human decency and the quality of public debate, especially when juxtaposed with defense counsel claims of "irritated" prosecution and victims' counsels<sup><a href="#fn10">[10]</a></sup>.</p>
      <p>There's also a tension around <strong>epistemic integrity</strong>, with criticisms of emotional appeals in legal defense<sup><a href="#fn11">[11]</a></sup> and general calls to question uncritical acceptance of information<sup><a href="#fn12">[12]</a></sup>.</p>
